### 1. What columns violate 1NF?
The columns that violate 1NF are **food_code**, **food_description**, because they contain multiple values in a single cell.

### 2. What entities do you recognize that could be extracted?
Here are entities that can be extracted:

Members: includes information about the members (columns: member_id, member_name, member_address);
Dinners: includes information about the dinners (columns: dinner_id, dinner_date, venue_code);
Venues: includes information about the venues where the dinners take place (columns: venue_code, venue_description);
Food Items: includes information about the food items served at the dinners (columns: food_code, food_description);

### 3. Name all the tables and columns that would make a 3NF compliant solution:
